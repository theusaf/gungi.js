Gungi is a two-player fictional strategy game created by Yoshihiro Togashi and is featured in the popular manga/anime series Hunter X Hunter. It draws aspects from similar games such as chess, shogi, and go, but adds an interesting 3rd dimension to gameplay by allowing pieces to be stacked on top of each other forming towers. A detailed ruleset was not specified in Togashi's work, however thanks to the Hunter X Hunter community the game has become a reality.

## Features/How To Play

Implemented game rules in this version are from the following sources:
- https://github.com/jwyce/Gungi (mostly just the concept)

- https://blog.goo.ne.jp/nishitsuji-sannkurou/e/aee5280f6c4109b22f594202947bcd2c

## TODO
